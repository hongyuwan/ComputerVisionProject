Instructions:
 The project was divided into three programs
	1st. livevid_I.cpp:
		Detect and Extract Chessboard Corners
		Select Calibration Images
		Calibrate the Camera
	This program saves camera matrix and distortion coefficients to /data/.
	2st. livevid_II.cpp:
		Calculate Current Position of the Camera
			Loads camera matrix and distortion coefficients data
		Project Outside Corners or 3D Axes (press A or A)
		Create virtual Object
			Diamond (press v or V)
			Icosahedron (press i or I)
			Aircraft (press e or E)
		Detect Robust Features
			Harris Corners (press h or H)
	3rd. livevid_III.cpp:
		ArUco functionalities
	calibration.cpp:
		All functionalities
