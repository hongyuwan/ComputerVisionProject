Travel Day Usage:
 We had to use one travel day for this project becuase I spent a couple days in
   Boston last weekend and I was working on Synthesis for Algorithm for an entire week.
 On the night of due date, we wasted tons of time because of the poor light sources at home.
   We had to finish and test all the task on the second day, 3/5.
 We submitted the project on 3/5 but we later realized there is something wrong with the code
   for task 7, knn, so we have resubmitted the project.
 We have talked to Dr. Maxwell about of the situations and he has approved.
 Thank you for your understanding.

Instructions:
 The entire project is based on GUI and
 user can easily use the GUI to operate
 different tasks and extensions to find
 the best matches from the database. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks:
 All tasks' results are available on the Wiki Page.
 Because we are working in pairs, we wrote the code for
 two of the first four tasks from scratch.

 Please visit the Wiki Page for more information.

Extensions:
 Three extensions are included in this project.
 Please visit the Wiki Page for more information.
	Extension 1: Graphical User Interface.
	Extension 2: More than required ten object in the DB.
	Extension 3: Enable to recognoize more than one object simultaneously.

To test executable for GUI, please run GUI.exe
